    <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Alfajor cake is made with layers of shortbread-like cookies and 
    <strong>dulce de leche</strong> cream - simply delicious! Serves 8.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1 (13.4 ounce) can dulce de leche</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>¼ cup powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Beat butter with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on
      medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and beat until
      light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of bowl as needed, about
      2 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating until incorporated after
      each addition, about 30 seconds.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a
      medium bowl until combined. Add flour mixture to butter mixture
      in 3 additions, alternating alternately with the milk, starting
      and ending with the flour mixture, and beat until combined after
      each addition.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and turn to coat dough.
      Knead dough 2 or 3 times. Divide dough into 5 equal pieces and shape
      each piece into a ball. Working with 1 ball at a time, roll dough
      into a 7-inch circle. Place dough circles on 2 large rimmed baking
      sheets lined with parchment paper (I fit 3 circles on 1 sheet and
      2 on the other). Chill dough circles, uncovered, for 1 hour.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prick each dough
      circle lightly with a fork.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until browned on bottom and light browned
      around the edges, 15 to 18 minutes. (If baking in 2 batches, keep
      second batch refrigerated while first batch bakes.) Cool cake layers
      completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Spoon dulce de leche into a medium bowl. Beat cream with an electric
      mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 6 minutes.
      Gently stir half of cream mixture into dulce de leche until combined.
      Gently fold remaining cream into dulce de leche mixture until combined.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Spread 1/3 cup of the dulce de leche mixture onto 1 cake layer, spreading
      to edges. Place onto a serving platter with dulce de leche mixture
      facing up. Repeat process with the next 3 cake layers (this is easier
      to spread on cake layers before placing on platter). Spread remaining
      2/3 cup dulce de leche mixture onto fifth cake layer and place on top.
      Let stand 1 hour. Dust top of cake with powdered sugar and serve.
      Cover any leftovers with plastic wrap and store in refrigerator up to 1 day.
