  <p>
    Homemade dough and filling make this apple strudel worth the work.

  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lard, melted</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 cup toasted bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 cup ground walnuts</li>
    <li>3 ½ pounds apples - peeled, cored and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>¾ cup raisins</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Sift all-purpose flour into a large bowl. Mix in egg, water, white
      sugar, lard and salt. Knead until soft and smooth. Lightly brush with
      approximately 1 tablespoon butter. Cover with a towel and set aside
      1 hour.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Mix bread crumbs and 3/4 cup butter in a medium bowl. Mix in ground
      walnuts, apples, raisins, cinnamon and sugar.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly butter a
      medium baking dish.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Spread a clean tablecloth or cotton sheet on a large work surface
      and dust with flour. Gently stretch the dough into a large, very thin
      rectangle as thin as tissue paper. Cut away thick edges. Sprinkle with
      approximately 1/2 cup melted butter. Spread bread crumb mixture across
      the dough, leaving a two inch border on all sides. Fold one end of the
      dough over the filling, then roll dough to form strudel. Cut so that
      it will fit the baking dish.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Place strudel in baking dish and brush with remaining butter. Bake
      in the preheated oven until golden brown and apples are tender,
      about 1 hour.
    </li>
  </ol>
